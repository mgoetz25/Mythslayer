# Mythslayer
FJCL 2019 State Forum submission for the 1st Place in the Computer Program 10-12 category.

Player chooses from 3 different mythological heroes (difficulty settings) and then chooses a category of questions (Grammar, History, Culture, etc). Gameplay consists of answering a given question in 15 seconds. Correctly answering will reward the player points and allow them to successfully attack the monster before them. Otherwise, their hero will take damage. The player attempts to answer as many questions within the time limit as they can or before their hero is slain.

All assets, sounds, and graphics were created by me.
